## 🎯 How to play?

The game gives you 6 guesses as a start. And you are expected to write the letter you want. <br>
If the letter you write is in the word, your guessing chance increases by one. <br>
If the letter is not in the word, your guessing chance decreases by one. <br>
We are trying to find the whole word before you finish your guess.
